\maketitle

In 2016, Donald J. Trump was elected President of the United States of America.
This event shocked spectators in the financial market, many of whom believed
that Hillary Clinton was likely to be elected. Thus President Trump's election
can be seen as a market shock, and should be analyzed as such.

Investors reevaluated several companies and industries in response to Trump's
election, one of which was the private prison industry. Hillary Clinton called
for ending private prisons, and private prison stocks dropped as a result
\cite{lamonica16}. Donald Trump, in comparison, supported private prisons, and
private prison stocks rose in value after his election \cite{sommer16}. Thus we
should see shock dynamics around the time of Donald Trump's election, on
November 8, 2016.

CoreCivic, formerly known as the Corrections Corporation of America (CCA), is a
major publicly owned private prison company, listed on the New York Stock
Exchange under the ticker symbol CXW. CoreCivic was exposed to the political
winds of 2016 and we would expect the behavior of the stock to change after the
surprise election of Donald Trump. Specifically, we would expect the Fama-French
\cite{famafrench15} adjusted returns to change. In order to detect such a
change, we need to fit the Fama-French 5-factor model to the daily returns of
CXW, which involves fitting the linear model

\begin{align}\label{ff5f}
	\begin{split}
		R_{t} - R_{Ft} &= \alpha + \beta_{Mt}(R_{Mt} - R_{Ft}) + \beta_{SMB} SMB_t \\
		& + \beta_{HML} HML_{t} + \beta_{RMW} RMW_t + \beta_{CMA} CMA_t + \epsilon_t
	\end{split}
\end{align}

In \eqref{ff5f}, $R_t$ is the return of the security or portfolio at time $t$;
$R_{Ft}$ is the risk-free rate of return; $R_{Mt}$ is the market return; $SMB_t$
is the return on a diversified portfolio of small stocks minus the return on a
diversified portfolio of big stocks; $HML_t$ is the return of a portfolio of
stocks with a high book-to-market (B/M) ratio minus the return of a portfolio of
stocks with a low B/M ratio; $RMW_t$ is the returns of a portfolio of stocks
with robust profitability minus a portfolio of stocks with weak profitability;
and finally $CMA_t$ is the return of a portfolio of stocks with conservative
investment minus the return of a portfolio of stocks with aggressive investment.

Kenneth French published data for estimating these coefficients on his website
\cite{french17}, and also comes with the package \textbf{CPAT} \cite{miller18}.
The data website Quandl provides free public historical daily stock price time
series, including the time series for CXW prices adjusted for stock splits and
dividends; Quandl was our source for CXW data. Thus, $R_t$ in \eqref{ff5f} is
the daily log returns of CXW.

We hypothesize that the Fama-French model parameters describing the behavior of
CXW changed around the time of Donald Trump's election to the U.S. Presidency,
and furthermore that the R\'enyi-type statistic designed for regression models
better detects this change than the univariate version of the R\'enyi-statistic
introduced in \cite{horvathricemiller19} or the other tests considered in our
power simulations. To check this, we not only performed these tests around the
time of the election but considered an expanding window of data, computing the
respective test statistics on each window of data as done in
\cite{horvathricemiller19}. All data sets start on the first trading day of 2016
(January 4) but the end point varies, being each trading day from October to
December 2016. All statistics except for the Hidalgo-Seo statistic use kernel
methods for estimating the long-run variance, as described in the simulations.
The trimming parameter for the R\'enyi-type statistics is $T^{\frac{1}{2}}$. We
consider $p$-values less than 0.05 to be statistically significant.

    \caption{$-\log_{10}{p}$-values of test statistics checking for structural
    change in the regression model described in \eqref{ff5f} computed on an
    expanding window of data, ranging from October 2 to December 30, 2016. The
    $y$-axis can be interpreted as tracking the number of zeros after the
    decimal point before the first significant digit of the $p$-value. The test
    statistics displayed include the R\'enyi-type statistic with trimming
    parameter $t_T = T^{1/2}$ computed with the regression model
    coefficients directly (\tikz[baseline=-0.5ex] \draw[thick](0,0) -- (1,0);)
    the R\'enyi-type statistic with trimming parameter $t_T = T^{1/2}$ computed
    on the residuals (\tikz[baseline=-0.5ex] \draw[thick, dash pattern=on 4pt
    off 4pt](0,0) -- (1,0);), the CUSUM statistic
    (\tikz[baseline=-0.5ex] \draw[thick, dash pattern=on 8pt off 4pt](0,0) --
    (1,0);), and the Hidalgo-Seo statistic
    (\tikz[baseline=-0.5ex]\draw[thick, dash dot](0,0) -- (1,0);). The
    R\'enyi-type statistic and CUSUM statistics are the univariate statistics
    computed on the estimated residuals of the regression model. The Hidalgo-Seo
    statistic was tailored to the regression context as described in their
    paper.}

We present the results of this analysis in Figure \ref{fig:cxwpvalplot}. We see
that the Hidalgo-Seo statistical always rejects the null hypothesis. While it is
possible that there was a change point prior to the election in 2016, we do not
believe that this is the reason the Hidalso-Seo statistic is rejecting the
null-hypothesis; given the results of our simulations, we believe the
Hidalgo-Seo statistic is showing signs of size inflation and making numerous
Type I errors. That said, we do see large changes to the $p$-values after the
election. The univariate R\'enyi-type statistic rejects the null hypothesis
prior to the election but suddenly does not reject the null hypothesis
afterwords; on the other hand, the CUSUM statistic doesn't reject the null
hypothesis prior to the election, then rejects it throughout the remainder of
November, then no longer rejects for most of December. The new R\'enyi-type
statistic for regression models does not reject prior to the election, rejects
the day after, hovers near the threshold of rejection throughout November, then
resumes rejection of the null hypothesis in December. Of all the statistics
listed here, this seems like the most reasonable behavior.
