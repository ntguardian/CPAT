\title{Structural Change in Oil Prices' Relationship to Dollar Strength; Power
       Demonstration}
\date{\today}

\maketitle

In this example we demonstrate structural change detection in the context of oil
prices' relationship with the U.S. Dollar. Commodities in general are priced in
dollars, and thus their prices tend to have an inverse relationship with the
overall strength of the dollar relative to other currencies; as the dollar
strengthens, commodity prices tend to fall. We see that pattern in oil prices as
well. In Figure \ref{fig:oildollar} we observe the inverse relationship between
dollar strength and oil price. Additionally, we observe that at least one of the
series (specifically, oil prices) appears to be heteroskedastic, with volatility
appearing to increase after the 1990s.

Consider the regression model

\begin{align}
    \label{eqn:oildollarmodel}
    \text{Oil}_{t}= \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Dollar}_{t}+\epsilon_{t}
,\end{align}

\noindent where $\text{Oil}_{t}$ is the price of oil in month $t$ and
$\text{Dollar}_{t}$ is the strength of the dollar as measured by a trade
weighted index. We present estimates for the coefficients of this model in Table
\ref{tab:oildollarfit}. We tested for structural breaks in the full sample and
rejected the null hypothesis of no change, with the best estimate (according to
the CUSUM test) of the location of the change being February, 2000. When we
split the data into two sub-samples around that date, we detected no further
structural changes.

    \caption{Estimated coefficients for model \eqref{eqn:oildollarmodel}. In the
    case of the model estimated on the full sample, the CUSUM statistic's
maximal value occurred around observation 122 (this is an estimate for the
location of the change point). Standard errors and the F statistic are robust to
heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation correlation, using the covariance matrix
estimation procedure suggested by \cite{andrews91b}. The CUSUM test was
performed with a covariance matrix estimated using kernel methods; see
\cite{horvathricemiller19}. The selected kernel was the Bartlett kernel and the
bandwidth was selected using the procedure described in \cite{lazarusetal18}.}
  \label{tab:oildollarfit} 
\end{table}

We also estimated $\text{MA}(1)$ models for the residuals $\epsilon_{t}$ of the
model; in unreported results, we also rejected the null hypothesis of no
structural change in the $\text{MA}(1)$ model for the residuals. Additionally,
it seems that, if $\epsilon_{t}=\theta \eta_{t-1}+ \eta_t$ with
$\text{Var}(\eta_t^2) = \sigma^2$, then $\sigma$ changes in the sample, increasing around the
time of the structural change in the full sample. This suggests that the
statistic developed here could prove useful, since we may have not only
structural change in the parameters of \eqref{eqn:oildollarmodel} but also
heteroskedasticity.

In our example we will accept the CUSUM test's conclusion that a change point
occurred in the sample around February 2000 and intend to demonstrate that our
procedure would detect this change not long after it occurred.

We attempted simulations to observe the behavior of the statistics studied in
this paper in contexts similar to what we saw in the data (although not
identical). To simulate the data for model \eqref{eqn:oildollarmodel}, we let
$\text{Dollar}_{t} - 100 \sim \operatorname{ARMA}(1, 1)$ with autocorrelation
parameter $\phi=0.985$ and moving average parameter $\theta=0.367$, with the
residuals being i.i.d. Gaussian with mean zero and variance $\sigma^2=1.323$. We
modelled the residuals with $\epsilon_{t} \sim \operatorname{MA}(1)$, with
$\theta=0.8$. The noise process for $\epsilon_t$, while always independent and
Gaussian distributed, is heteroskedastic; for $t\le 108$, the variance of the
white noise was 2, but for $t>108$ the variance was 50. We let the break point
in the simulations occur at  $t^*=122$, let  $T=130$, let the parameter vector
$\bm{\beta}=(\beta_0,\beta_1)^\top $ before the change point be
$\bm{\beta}_{0}=(41.308, -0.238)^\top $, and after the change be
$\bm{\beta}_1 = \bm{\gamma} \delta$, where $\bm{\gamma}=(329.925,
-2.809)^\top  - (41.308, -0.238)^\top $ and $\delta\in [0,2]$. Note that
$\delta=0$ corresponds to the null hypothesis of no change being true.

We should mention that while in our previous simulations we estimated long-run
variance matrices using techniques recommended in \cite{andrews91b} (using
Andrews' procedure and the quadratic spectral kernel), in this section the
statistics use the Bartlett kernel and pick the bandwidth using the procedure
recommended by \cite{lazarusetal18}. The trimming parameter for the
R\'{e}nyi-type statistics, though, is still the square root function.

We present our results in Figure \ref{fig:powerplotexample}. All statistics
exhibit size inflation when computed on the simulated data. Also, in the
simulations, it seems that the new statistic doesn't get better power than the
CUSUM statistic until $\delta>1.5$. However, the new statistic and the CUSUM
statistic both seem to suffer the least from size inflation. The R\'{e}nyi-type
statistic recommended by \cite{horvathricemiller19} sees considerable size
inflation in this context, and the Hidalgo-Seo statistic is the most inflated of
them all. We do note that the new procedure exhibits power, though, along with
the other procedures. Additionally, we observed similar size inflation for $T$
closer to $t^{*}$.

As stated above, our goal is to demonstrate that the new procedure could detect
a structural change soon after it occurred in the sample. To do so, we employed
a procedure like that used in \cite{horvathricemiller19}. We considered an
expanding window of data, where the left end point of the window was fixed at
January 1990 and the right end point moved forward in time, adding additional
months to the sample. We wish to see when each statistic would start rejecting
the null hypothesis of no change.

    \caption{$-\log_{10}(p)$-values for the statistics featured in Figure
    \ref{fig:powerplotexample} when computed on an expanding window of the data

The $y$-axis can be interpreted as the number of zeros before the first
significant digit of the  $p$-value of the test done with the respective
statistic. Crossing above the dotted line implies rejection of the null
hypothesis of no change at significance level  $\alpha=0.05$.}
    \label{fig:oildollarexpandingwindow}
\end{figure}

We present our results in Figure \ref{fig:oildollarexpandingwindow}. While the
simulations suggested that size inflation could be a problem, this does not
appear to be the case in the actual data except for the two statistics that
experienced the most size inflation. The CUSUM statistic does not reject the
null hypothesis in the observed region, the Hidalgo-Seo statistic always does,
the original R\'{e}nyi-type statistic sometimes does not and sometimes does, and
the new version of the R\'{e}nyi-type statistic gradually goes from not
rejecting the null hypothesis to rejecting at the end of the window in a
visually linear manner, and thus seems the most well-behaved of the statistics
considered here.

We admit that the simulation results presented in Figure
\ref{fig:powerplotexample} cast doubt on the validity of our conclusions made in
the above paragraph. We could have been lucky in observing a reasonable pattern
in the data. However, it is possible that some of the features that appeared in
simulated data were not as big an issue as they were in the real data; the
statistical features we simulated may have been a rough approximation of the
real data's features. In any case, the size inflation seen in the simulations
may have been overstated in absolute terms, but the relative size inflation may
be meaningful.
