    abstract="Despite its large sample efficiency, the truncated flat kernel (TF) estimator of long-run covariance matrices is seldom used, because it occasionally gives a non-positive semidefinite estimate and sometimes performs poorly in small samples, compared to other familiar kernel estimators. This paper proposes simple modifications to the TF estimator to enforce the positive definiteness without sacrificing the large sample efficiency and make the estimator more reliable in small samples through better utilization of the bias-variance trade-off. We study the large sample properties of the modified TF estimators and verify their improved small-sample performances by Monte Carlo simulations.",

    abstract = {A new class of change point test statistics is proposed that utilizes a weighting and trimming scheme for the cumulative sum (CUSUM) process inspired by Rényi. A thorough asymptotic analysis and simulations both demonstrate that this new class of statistics possess superior power compared to traditional change point statistics based on the CUSUM process when the change point is near the beginning or end of the sample. Generalizations of these “Rényi” statistics are also developed to test for changes in the parameters in linear and nonlinear regression models, and in generalized method of moments estimation. In these contexts, we applied the proposed statistics, as well as several others, to test for changes in the coefficients of Fama–French factor models. We observed that the Rényi statistic was the most effective in terms of retrospectively detecting change points that occur near the endpoints of the sample. }

 abstract = {This paper considers tests for structural instability of short duration, such as at the end of the sample. The key feature of the testing problem is that the number, m, of observations in the period of potential change is relatively small--possibly as small as one. The well-known F test of Chow (1960) for this problem only applies in a linear regression model with normally distributed iid errors and strictly exogenous regressors, even when the total number of observations, n + m, is large. We generalize the F test to cover regression models with much more general error processes, regressors that are not strictly exogenous, and estimation by instrumental variables as well as least squares. In addition, we extend the F test to nonlinear models estimated by generalized method of moments and maximum likelihood. Asymptotic critical values that are valid as n → ∞ with m fixed are provided using a subsampling-like method. The results apply quite generally to processes that are strictly stationary and ergodic under the null hypothesis of no structural instability.},

  abstract = {This paper gives an account of some of the recent work on structural breaks in time series models. In particular, we show how procedures based on the popular cumulative sum, CUSUM, statistics can be modified to work also for data exhibiting serial dependence. Both structural breaks in the unconditional and conditional mean as well as in the variance and covariance/correlation structure are covered. CUSUM procedures are nonparametric by design. If the data allows for parametric modeling, we demonstrate how likelihood approaches may be utilized to recover structural breaks. The estimation of multiple structural breaks is discussed. Furthermore, we cover how one can disentangle structural breaks (in the mean and/or the variance) on one hand and long memory or unit roots on the other. Several new lines of research are briefly mentioned.}
