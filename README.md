**CPAT** is a package implementing some statistical tests for detecting
structural change in a series of data. The tests made publicly available are:

* The CUSUM test, via `CUSUM.test()`
* The Darling-Erdös test, via `DE.test()`
* The Hidalgo-Seo test, via `HS.test()`
* Andrews test, via `Andrews.test()`
* The Rényi-type test via `HR.test()`

This package was written to facilitate the simulations performed in
a paper by Horváth, Rice and Miller (see the documentation for `HR.test()` for a
citation) and thus is geared to change point tests capable of detecting
early/late changes in a sample. That said, it is general purpose.

## Installation

[**CPAT** is available on CRAN.](https://cran.r-project.org/package=CPAT) You
should be able to install CPAT with the command `install.packages("CPAT")`.

You can install **CPAT** from GitHub via the R command `devtools::install_github("ntguardian/CPAT")`.

It is possible that you have uncompressed the archive containing not only the
source code of the package but also the source code of the project, including
data files, plots, etc. If that's the case, start an R session while in the base
directory of the project then run the command `devtools::install()`. This should
install the project.

## Change Point Testing

Change point testing is performed on sequential data (such as time series) to
determine whether the data shares a common structure. In particular, let <img src="svgs/7dc84c89f1e5da273e175b2e993d7568.svg" align=middle width=88.74605684999997pt height=22.465723500000017pt/> where <img src="svgs/cbf94b0a9fb4d880661a1ab1549ca813.svg" align=middle width=11.638184249999991pt height=14.15524440000002pt/> is a random noise process, with <img src="svgs/362d8e4d972dd3d1b39e5ac702ccb065.svg" align=middle width=69.87988259999999pt height=22.465723500000017pt/>. With the exception of Andrews' test, the tests mentioned above can be
used to decide between the hypotheses:

<p align="center"><img src="svgs/5947ee678ee7dcfdf936bcf342c61eaa.svg" align=middle width=147.93501855pt height=14.42921205pt/></p>

<p align="center"><img src="svgs/42e55b067318cf60970880f6368161f3.svg" align=middle width=265.5109809pt height=15.251136449999997pt/></p>

<img src="svgs/c3463d14e48df82e1f401d74ed6f6b50.svg" align=middle width=12.671292149999989pt height=22.63846199999998pt/> is an integer satisfying <img src="svgs/054bbcd93c6d19b7495a124b86d4466c.svg" align=middle width=77.43697004999999pt height=22.63846199999998pt/>. Critically, <img src="svgs/c3463d14e48df82e1f401d74ed6f6b50.svg" align=middle width=12.671292149999989pt height=22.63846199999998pt/> is
not assumed to be known, so the alternative hypothesis states that the change
occurs at an unknown location in the sample.

Andrews' test is an exception; his test assumes some information about where the
change occured. Suppose <img src="svgs/b291ae2f55b6bd72678ff4286e2fc88b.svg" align=middle width=47.51516714999999pt height=14.15524440000002pt/> for <img src="svgs/f04a51c20f8126acde9a35f5e4fa10d5.svg" align=middle width=73.50434024999998pt height=30.984656999999984pt/> with <img src="svgs/7806dba05980d14c3275f87bb652fb06.svg" align=middle width=50.96455154999999pt height=30.984656999999984pt/>
and <img src="svgs/1887f66d89e5fde468bb8a6490974674.svg" align=middle width=15.513771899999991pt height=30.984656999999984pt/> known. His test decides between the hypotheses:

<p align="center"><img src="svgs/cc69200b1a88235d47c751148efef228.svg" align=middle width=191.18445555pt height=17.214641399999998pt/></p>

<p align="center"><img src="svgs/08a0506b4acfc21fc268e156d75efc38.svg" align=middle width=341.40484619999995pt height=17.39730795pt/></p>

In this case, <img src="svgs/1481b0ec8b302954a5be1ea5b6482352.svg" align=middle width=86.37536819999998pt height=30.984656999999984pt/>.

Change point testing traces its roots to quality control procedures; if one
imagines <img src="svgs/a918cf04cd0ac7535e7626be634cfb9e.svg" align=middle width=18.58454399999999pt height=22.465723500000017pt/> being some measurement of a part produced by an machine, <img src="svgs/30074edb23bec8e7c47c584ff885e5b5.svg" align=middle width=20.21695004999999pt height=22.465723500000017pt/>
states that the machine was always calibrated while the alternative hypothesis
claimes that the machine became uncalibrated at some unknown porint in time.
Another view of a change point test is that it's yet another test to check if a
time series is stationary, which is a critical assumption made in most analyses
involving time series.

While the above formulation describes a test primarily concerned about the mean
of a process, these tests, even in this form, can make statements about
structural change other than the mean. For instance, if <img src="svgs/a918cf04cd0ac7535e7626be634cfb9e.svg" align=middle width=18.58454399999999pt height=22.465723500000017pt/> represents the
residuals of a regression model, the test checks whether the parameters of the
model are stable over time or not.

All of the tests included in this package are asymptotic tests; the test
performs better for large <img src="svgs/2f118ee06d05f3c2d98361d9c30e38ce.svg" align=middle width=11.889314249999991pt height=22.465723500000017pt/> and one should be cautious when using these tests
for small <img src="svgs/2f118ee06d05f3c2d98361d9c30e38ce.svg" align=middle width=11.889314249999991pt height=22.465723500000017pt/>. Simulations studies suggest that the Rényi-type test seems to
perform best when a change occurs near the ends of a sample, while the CUSUM
test seemed to perform best when the change occured mid-sample.

## Example

Each function can accept a univariate dataset as input, and will return an
`htest`-class object with the results of the test.


```r
library(CPAT)

set.seed(20180924)
x <- c(rnorm(250), rnorm(50) + 1)

CUSUM.test(x)
#> 
#> 	CUSUM Test for Change in Mean
#> 
#> data:  x
#> A = 1.8875, p-value = 0.001609
#> sample estimates:
#>  t* 
#> 250
DE.test(x)
#> 
#> 	Darling-Erdos Test for Change in Mean
#> 
#> data:  x
#> A = 3.7528, a(log(T)) = 1.8661, b(log(T)) = 3.1872, p-value =
#> 0.04582
#> sample estimates:
#>  t* 
#> 251
HS.test(x)
#> 
#> 	Hidalgo-Seo Test for Change in Mean
#> 
#> data:  x
#> A = 11.783, Correlated Residuals = 1, p-value = 0.00551
#> sample estimates:
#>  t* 
#> 251
HR.test(x)
#> 
#> 	Horvath-Rice Test for Change in Mean
#> 
#> data:  x
#> D = 2.2145, log(T) = 5.7038, p-value = 0.1043
#> sample estimates:
#>  t* 
#> 284
Andrews.test(x, M = 250)
#> 
#> 	Andrews' Test for Structural Change
#> 
#> data:  x
#> S = 52.63, m = 50, p-value = 0.2388
```

Often these tests return a test statistic, a <img src="svgs/2ec6e630f199f589a2402fdf3e0289d5.svg" align=middle width=8.270567249999992pt height=14.15524440000002pt/>-value, and the estimated
location of the change. This latter quantity is the arg-max of the terms the
test statistics maximize. (There is theory supporting this estimator for the
CUSUM test, but no theory for the Rényi-type test.)

`Andrews.test()` also allows for testing for structural change in a linear model
directly.


```r
df <- data.frame(x = x, y = 1 + 2 * x + c(rnorm(250), rnorm(50) + 1))
Andrews.test(df, M = 250, formula = y ~ x)
#> 
#> 	Andrews' Test for Structural Change
#> 
#> data:  df
#> S = 6.3494, m = 50, p-value < 2.2e-16
```

## Project Replication

The source of this package does more than make the package available to R. It
also includes all code necessary to recreate the simulations performed in the
paper by Horvath, Miller and Rice ("A new class of change point test statistics
of Rényi type", ????). Some versions of the source may even include the files
containing the simulation studies already created.

While the `R/` directory contains definitions for functions useful both for
implementing these tests and performing our simulations, the `exec/` directory
contains the scripts (executable from the command line at least on UNIX-like
systems) that perform the simulations and the file `Makefile` in the root
directory uses GNU `make` to manage the structure of the project. Together these
allow for simulations to be replicated.

We recommend learning how to use GNU `make` to fully appreciate the contents of
`Makefile` (the
[manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Overview), when read
according to the authors' recommendations, is a good introduction), but one can
get started without fully appreciating `make`'s intricacies. Below I assume GNU
`make` is installed and the base directory of the project is the working
directory:

* The command `make clean` will remove every file associated with the
  simulations studies; this represents a clean build. Beware, though, that some
  simulations can take days to complete even on a supercomputer, so don't `make
  clean` without careful consideration. The command `make mostlyclean` will
  clean up many of the files associated with the project but does not remove
  files generated from extensive simulations studies.
* `make` will automatically update all files that are out of date, based on the
  timestamps of the files in question. All dependencies are tracked in
  `Makefile`.
* If the project is clean, running `make` may not create all simulations since
  the files that would contain the results of plots don't exist, causing `make`
  to decide that they don't need to be updated. The command `make init` will
  create dummy versions of some of these files, which will certainly have newer
  time stamps than their dependencies. (These are three dummy PDF files that
  aren't even binary files; beware that this will overwrite those files if they
  already exist.) Running `make` immediately after `make init` should rebuild
  the project.
* Since the simulations take a long time to perform with the full sample sizes,
  the command `make small` will do the same as `make` but with much fewer
  replications (by default, 20 replications per simulation). This is good for
  testing to see if a setup works.
* A number of parameters are defined in `make` variables defined at the
  beginning of `Makefile`, and these variables can be overridden in the command
  line. For example, `make LEVEL=0.01` will remake the project but with the
  tests involved in the power simulations using a significance level of 0.01
  rather than 0.05 (this will remake the simulations only if the relevant files,
  specifically the CSV metadata files, are out of date). `make small
  SMALLREPLICATIONS=50` is like `make small` but performs 50 replications rather
  than the default 20. See `Makefile` for all variables used.

We once used the R package **packrat** to manage package dependencies but
unfortunately this would not work with critical systems for performing the
simulations. There's also no tracking of system dependencies. We tracked the
packages we needed in the file `exec/GetPackages.R`, which can be executed from
the command line using either the command `Rscript exec/GetPackages.R` or
`exec/GetPackages.R` directly (depending on whether the file is marked as
executable). If executed, R will attempt to download and install all project
dependencies we are aware of. As for system dependencies, a sufficiently recent
version of R and `Rscript` are needed, and LaTeX with the **tikz** package
should be available and accessible to the **tikzDevice** package. Additionally,
**CPAT** itself should be installed; the scripts in `exec/` not only use
**CPAT** but use private **CPAT** functions (accessed via `:::`). If the source
has been uncompressed, running the R command `devtools::install()` to install
the package should be sufficient.

We do not guarantee that once the simulations are run with `make` the result
will be a valid R package (let alone CRAN-compliant), but we have never had
issues yet running simulations then using `devtools::install()` in the base
directory of the source of the package to install **CPAT**.

## Planned Future Features

* Currently, `Andrews.test()` only works for late changes, but Andrews' paper
  allows for tests for instability in both the beginning and middle of the
  sample. `Andrews.test()` should support these types of tests.
* We could include more tests, including those mentioned in the paper by [Aue and
  Horváth (2013)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9892.2012.00819.x)
  and [Horváth and Rice (2014)](http://www.math.utah.edu/~rice/HorvathRice(2014)change.pdf).
