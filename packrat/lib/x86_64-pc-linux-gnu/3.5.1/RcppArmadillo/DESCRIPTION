Description: 'Armadillo' is a templated C++ linear algebra library (by
    Conrad Sanderson) that aims towards a good balance between speed
    and ease of use. Integer, floating point and complex numbers are
    supported, as well as a subset of trigonometric and statistics
    functions. Various matrix decompositions are provided through
    optional integration with LAPACK and ATLAS libraries. The
    'RcppArmadillo' package includes the header files from the
    templated 'Armadillo' library. Thus users do not need to install
    'Armadillo' itself in order to use 'RcppArmadillo'. From release
    7.800.0 on, 'Armadillo' is licensed under Apache License 2;
    previous releases were under licensed as MPL 2.0 from version
    3.800.0 onwards and LGPL-3 prior to that; 'RcppArmadillo' (the
    'Rcpp' bindings/bridge to Armadillo) is licensed under the GNU GPL
    version 2 or later, as is the rest of 'Rcpp'. Note that Armadillo
    requires a fairly recent compiler; for the g++ family at least
    version 4.6.* is required.
